# StreamX Client
The Roblox handler to connect and use all StreamX resources.
---
### Setup instructions
If you want a stable release, copy `StreamX.lua` to `ServerScriptStorage` and fill out the configuration.  This will give you a fully stable StreamX game; however, if you want the latest object support (or just newer code), you can copy `BitBuffer.lua` and `Serializer.lua` while placing them like so:  
├── StreamX (Script)  
│		├── BitBuffer (ModuleScript)  
│		├── Serializer (ModuleScript)  

This will force the StreamX client to load the local modules and therefore give you more recent updates.

### Contributions

While the backend is proprietary, this client is very much open-source and open for contributions.
